This is code to implement Collaborative Filtering using the User-based, Item-based similarity algorithms on the MovieLens data.
The R files also run the Matrix Factorization and SlopeOne algorithms to return the RMSE for each.

I have implemented User-Based silimilarity with "Genre" also into consideration. This way the cosine similarity also takes into consideration the 
"Genre" of a movie before predicting a rating and recommending a movie.
